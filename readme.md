### Who Am I?
I am Eyal Ran a student in the June 2021 cohort of the Fellows
Data-Science Training Program operated by <itc>.

### How can I help?
Well, this is part of Git exercise 6, and therefore, there is
not much you can do, unless you are a checker, and in that case,
you can help by returning that exercise.

### Anything else I should know?
Not really, and again, if you are not an <itc> assignment
checker, you should probably move on to some more interesting
public projects. Nothing to see here.
